# Discontinued
This theme is no longer being updated due to me no longer working on Roblox stuff. As such, this theme has probably been broken immediately due to Roblox website changes.

# This version of Safe Mode is always going to be out of date.

## Safe Mode for Roblox
Safe Mode is a work in progress "safe mode" for Roblox. Think of it like a privacy mode or a streamer mode; It hides many things.

This is a heavy WIP. Some things may not work or some info that is supposed to be hidden may be shown.

This theme hides your Inventory, prevents you from modifying your Settings and About, hides Friends, disables Notifications and Website Chat, prevents Robux/Premium purchasing, hide groups events, the group wall and group owners, the create page link (however the create page is not hidden itself), search dialog popup, and some navbar items. There are some more hidden/modified things, but I can't remember what else I hid.
